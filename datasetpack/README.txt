Quick Start Guide

This is supposed to be a readme file of the datasetpack I have developed in the subject. 
This package includes some basic functions developed during the course as exercises in the "Software matematico y estadistico" subject. These functions enable working with datasets, including tasks such as normalization, standardization, discretization, and plotting, by using a custom class called dataset.
